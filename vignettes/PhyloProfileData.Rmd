# Introduction
The PhyloProfileData package contains the following data objects:

1. A preprocessed NCBI taxonomy data required by PhyloProfile package, and

2. Two experimental datasets to illustrate running and analysing phylogenetic 
profiles with PhyloProfile.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(PhyloProfileData)
data(package = "PhyloProfileData")
```

# Preprocessed NCBI taxonomy data
The *PhyloProfile* package provides two unique features in comparison to other
existing phylogenetic profiling tools. One of them the ability to rapidly change
the resolution of the comparative analysis of proteins in individual species, to
that acros classes, phyla or entire kingdoms by collapsing the input taxa into 
the corresponding systematic ranks. The other feature is that, *PhyloProfile* 
can automatically order the input taxa in increasing taxonomic distance from a 
user-specified reference taxon. Furthermore, *PhyloProfile* can convert the 
input taxon IDs into the scientific names for the presentation of the profiles,
which enable a more informative picture than showing only the taxon IDs. 

Those features are only available when we link the taxon IDs in the input 
phylogenetic profile with their full taxonomy information including the IDs and 
the scientific names from the lowest systematic rank (e.g. `strain` or 
`species`) up to the root of the species tree (e.g. `cellular organism`).

There are packages that can get the NCBI taxonomy ranks and IDs for a given 
taxon (such as *taxize*), however getting these information on the fly for a 
large number of taxa and parsing them can be time consuming. Therefore we 
provide a preprocessed taxonomy file for *PhyloProfile* that contains required 
information for those related functions. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load data
data("ncbiTaxonNamesFull")
head(ncbiTaxonNamesFull)
```

The preprocessed taxonomy file contains the NCBI taxonomy ID for each taxon, 
their corresponding scientific name, the current systematic rank and the ID of 
its higher rank (parent ID). These information were parsed from the `names.dmp`
and `nodes.dmp` files downloaded from 
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdmp.zip. This data contains 
2.110.551 entries, correspond to the complete NCBI taxonomy database (Federhen, 
2012) on May 13th 2019.

# Experimental datasets

## Phylogenetic profiles of AMPK-TOR pathway

The phylogenetic profiles of 147 human proteins in the AMPK-TOR pathway across 
83 species in the three domains of life were taken from the study of Roustan et 
al. 2016. 

This data set includes 3 files: 

- A phylogenetic profile input contains the human protein IDs, the taxaonomy IDs
of the 83 search species and the corresponding orthologous protein IDs in those 
species, together with two additional values, the forward and backward feature
architecture similarity (FAS) scores. *FAS approach* (Dosch et al. 2019) is an 
enhancement of *FACT* (Koestler et al. 2010) which give an idea how similar two 
proteins are in term of functional equivalence. These compared protein features 
can be the functional PFAM or SMART domains, the transmembran domains, secondary
structures or low complexity regions of the protein. FAS scores have a range 
between 0 and 1, where 1 is for a protein pair that have identical 
architectures, and 0 in cases that two proteins are completely different in 
their architectures.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("ampkTorPhyloProfile")
head(ampkTorPhyloProfile)
```

- A multiple fasta object contains the FASTA sequences for all the proteins 
present in the data set.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("ampkTorFasta")
head(ampkTorFasta)
```

- A data frame contains the domain annotation for the proteins present in 
the phylogenetic profiles. The protein domain annotations were done using 
different annotation tools and databases, including *PFAM*, *SMART*, *CAST*, 
*COILS2*, *SEG*, *SignalP*, and *TMHMM*. The annotation types together with 
their domain name and the corresponding start and end positions are stored in 
this domain data frame.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("ampkTorDomain")
head(ampkTorDomain)
```

## Phylogenetic profiles of Arthropoda proteins

One fundamental step in establishing the phylogenetic profiles is searching 
orthologs for the query proteins in different taxa of interest. *HaMStR-oneseq*, 
an extended version of *HaMStR* (Ebersberger et al. 2009), has been shown to be 
an promising approach for sensitively predicting orthologs even in the distantly 
related taxa from the query species, which is required for the phylogenetic 
profiling of a broad range of taxa through all domains of the species tree of 
life. One main parameter for HaMStR-oneseq is the core ortholog group, the 
starting point for the orthology search. In order to set up a reliable core 
ortholog set that can be used for further phylogenetic profiling studies, we 
made use of the well-known *BUSCO* datasets (Simão et al. 2015). Here we 
represent the phylogenetic profile of 1011 ortholog groups across 89 species, 
which was calculated from the BUSCO arthropoda dataset downloaded from 
https://busco.ezlab.org/datasets/arthropoda_odb9.tar.gz in Jan. 2018. The 88 
species included 10 arthropoda species (Ladona fulva, Agrilus planipennis, Polypedilum vanderplanki, Daphnia magna, 
Harpegnathos saltator, Zootermopsis nevadensis, Halyomorpha halys, 
Heliconius melpomene, Stegodyphus mimosarum, Drosophila willistoni) downloaded from orthoDB version 10 
(https://www.orthodb.org) and 78 species of the QfO dataset (REF).

This dataset includes 3 files:

- A phylogenetic profile input contains 1011 BUSCO ortholog group IDs, the 
taxaonomy IDs of the 88 searched species and the corresponding orthologous protein IDs in 
those species, together with two additional values, the forward and backward FAS 
scores which is descriped above in the description of the AMPK-TOR pathway.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("arthropodaPhyloProfile")
head(arthropodaPhyloProfile)
```

- A multiple fasta object contains the FASTA sequences for all the proteins 
present in the data set.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("arthropodaFasta")
head(arthropodaFasta)
```

- A data frame contains the domain annotation for the proteins present in 
the phylogenetic profiles. The protein domain annotations were done using 
different annotation tools and databases, including *PFAM*, *SMART*, *CAST*, 
*COILS2*, *SEG*, *SignalP*, and *TMHMM*. The annotation types together with 
their domain name and the corresponding start and end positions are stored in 
this domain data frame.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data("arthropodaDomain")
head(arthropodaDomain)
